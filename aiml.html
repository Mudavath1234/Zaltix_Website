      <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. These machines can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. AI encompasses a broad range of technologies and techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is Machine Learning (ML)?</h2>
      <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms are trained on large datasets, allowing them to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time. Key types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Supervised Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Supervised Learning uses labeled data to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. Common algorithms include linear regression, support vector machines, and decision trees.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Unsupervised Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Unsupervised Learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships. Common techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule mining.
